  <h2>PDP CRISIS DEEPENS AS FACTIONS CLASH OVER PARTY LEADERSHIP AMIDST LEGAL BATTLES</h2>
  <p> 
   <img class="soccer" src="pol.jpg" alt="sports">
The current leadership tussle within thyt Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the country  has taken a serious dimension, as the factional acting National Chairman, Yayari Mohammed, challenges the rival faction led by Umar Damagum to address their security concerns.<br><br>

The party, which has been embroiled in internal crisis since 2022, is now split into two factions, each asserting its control over the party’s National Working Committee (NWC).<br><br>

Recently, Ibrahim Abdullahi, the acting National Publicity Secretary of the Damagum-led NWC faction,in a press conference in Abuja, warned that security measures might be taken against the Mohammed faction to maintain order and uphold the rule of law amid the ongoing disputes.<br><br>

The crisis reached a boiling point on Friday when the PDP’s leadership formally fractured. Yayari Mohammed and Umar Damagum emerged as leaders of opposing factions, intensifying the battle for control over the party.<br><br>

The division was triggered by the suspension of the National Legal Adviser, Adeyemi Ajibade, and the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, by the Damagum-led NWC faction following its 593rd meeting.<br><br>

In their place, Ibrahim Abdullahi and Okechukwu Osuoha were appointed to serve in acting capacities.<br><br>

In a swift counteraction, Ologunagba, the suspended National Publicity Secretary, issued a statement announcing the suspension of Umar Damagum and National Secretary Samuel Anyanwu, citing numerous complaints lodged against them.<br><br>

The internal power struggle has thrown the PDP into a legal quagmire, with each faction vying for dominance.<br><br>

Amidst the turmoil, a Federal High Court in Abuja intervened, issuing an order restraining the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) and the Board of Trustees from removing Damagum as the acting National Chairman.<br><br>

In a judgment delivered via Zoom, Justice Peter Lifu ruled that Damagum must remain in his position until the party’s next convention, slated for December 2025. The ruling effectively blocks any attempt to recognize another leader as the party’s acting chairman during this period.<br><br>

At the Monday press briefing, Abdullahi cautioned the Mohammed faction against defying the court’s ruling, asserting that the judgment clearly establishes Damagum as the legitimate leader of the PDP.<br><br>

As the party grapples with its internal conflicts, the future of the opposition remains uncertain, with both factions determined to solidify their control ahead of the crucial 2025 convention.<br><br>

He stated, “We must ensure that certain actions are not guided by sentiments and personal interests, but by the party’s constitution.<br><br>

In the face of this reckless violation of a subsisting court order, we are left with no option but to deploy the services of security agencies to enforce the rule of law.<br><br>

Abdullahi added that to enhance the learning process of party leadership and administration, members must ensure that actions were based on the party’s constitution and existing guidelines, rather than influenced by “sentiments and personal interests.”
  <br><br>
He added, “Let all concerned know that the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, my humble self, now acting National Publicity Secretary and Deputy National Legal Adviser and now Acting National Legal Adviser assumed office following the Decision of the NWC; and it is in line with the PDP Constitution (2017 as Amended) following the absence of our substantive officers. It is made abundantly clear in Section 40(2) and 42(2).<br><br>

It is therefore distasteful for a leader who ought to inform the uninformed but instead goes ahead to misinform on a national television and other media channels that our assumption of office in acting capacity is unconstitutional and does not exist. Why?<br><br>

Furthermore, we are constrained to express our utter disgust and disappointment in our colleagues’ resort to motor park approach to a mere suspension aimed at providing them with the opportunity to clear themselves of certain allegations against them.<br><br>

Although we have detailed knowledge of the drummers, the masqueraders should have been guided in their dance steps to avert stripping themselves naked on the stage.<br><br>

However, in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH on Monday, new factional chairman Mohammed stated that they would heed the party leaders rather than respond to threats.<br><br>

He stated, “We have submitted all our positions and views to the organs of the party: the governors’ forum, the Board of Trustees, and other members of the party. We have expressed our concerns and reasons for our stance.
  <br><br>
They have assured us that they will take a position and get back to us. Therefore, we are not worried about any threats; they should go ahead and carry out theirs.<br><br>

“We have expressed our concerns clearly. The party’s constitution should be obeyed, and that is our demand.<br><br>

I am also sure that from now till Friday our leaders will get back to us. We will listen to them and not to threats.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the governors elected under the PDP adjourned their meeting regarding the crisis to Tuesday (today) after Monday’s meeting ended without the governors reaching a compromise.<br><br>

A national officer of the party, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not being authorised to speak on the matter, confirmed that the meeting held via Zoom by the PDP Governors Forum, led by Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, could not be concluded.<br><br>

He stated, “The meeting started around 5pm, but they could not finish the meeting today (Monday).They will continue tomorrow (today).<br><br>

The PUNCH reports that following the escalation of the party’s internal crisis over the weekend, the governors convened the emergency meeting for Monday.<br><br>

The move to remove Damagum has split the PDP governors, with the Chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum and Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, leading six other governors pushing for Damagum’s ouster.<br><br>

With Mohammed are Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke; Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki; Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri; Rivers State Governor, Siminalayi Fubara; Delta State Governor, Sheriff Oborevwori; and Akwa Ibom State Governor Umo Eno.<br><br>

Meanwhile, four other governors, led by Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde are opposed to Damagum’s removal.<br><br>

Others with Makinde are Governors Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State, Caleb Mutfwang of Plateau State, and Agbu Kefas of Taraba State.<br><br>

However, two out of the 13 governors are neutral. They are Governor Peter Mbah of Enugu State and Dauda Lawal of Zamfara State.<br><br>

Before the suspensions that rocked the PDP on Friday, the party had scheduled a NEC meeting for October 24 to elect a substantive national chairman to complete the tenure of Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, while Damagum was expected to revert to his position as National Vice Chairman (North).<br><br>

It way learnt that the state governors were considering the appointment of a caretaker committee to run the affairs of the party until December 2025, when the tenure of the present NWC would expire.<br><br>

However, following Monday’s inconclusive online meeting, the PDP governors will be hoping to reach a comprise on the crisis today.<br><br>

Meanwhile, a chieftain of the party, Dr. Adetokunbo Pearse, has said that the current situation in the party’s national structure is not a crisis but a power tussle, common to political parties globally.<br><br>

He insisted that the disagreement between Damagun’s group and the Ologunagba group within the party’s NWC was just a struggle.<br><br>

He, however, assured that the current crisis would not lead to a collapse of the opposition party.<br><br>

And as for whether Damagun should go or stay , it should be remembered that the Party has stated repeatedly that in line with the PDP Constitution, Damagun as Acting National Chairman will be replaced by a substantive National Chairman from the Zone of Dr Ayu, the last substantive National Chairman.<br><br>

This could happen as early as 24th October 2024 when the National Executive Committee, the Party’s most powerful organ is scheduled to meet,” he said.
